## üìã Usage Instructions for Claude AI

### When to Use Todoist Export

Claude should automatically use this integration when you:

- Ask to "export to Todoist" or "send to my tasks"
- Say phrases like "add these to my todo list" or "create tasks for these"
- When conversations naturally produce action items that should be tracked
- When planning sessions result in concrete next steps

### Implementation Code

#### Recommended Method (Quick Export)
```javascript
fetch('https://todoist.bagofholding.co.uk/quick-export', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: `[extracted action items from our conversation]`,
    mainTaskTitle: "[descriptive title for the main task]", // optional but recommended
    projectName: "[project name like 'Work' or 'Personal']" // optional, defaults to Inbox
  })
})
```

#### Simple Method
```javascript
fetch('https://todoist.bagofholding.co.uk/simple-export', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: `[action items from our conversation]`
  })
})
```

#### Preview Method
```javascript
fetch('https://todoist.bagofholding.co.uk/extract-actions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: `[conversation text to analyze]`
  })
})
```

### Action Item Extraction Guidelines

Claude should extract action items by:

- **Identifying concrete, actionable tasks** from conversations
- **Including bullet points, numbered lists**, and explicit action statements
- **Looking for key phrases** like:
  - "I need to..."
  - "Next steps include..."
  - "Action items:"
  - "TODO:"
  - "Remember to..."
- **Converting discussion points** into specific, actionable tasks
- **Maintaining original context** and specificity

### Response Format

After successful export, Claude should confirm with:

```
‚úÖ I've exported [X] action items to your Todoist [project name]. The main task '[title]' contains [X] subtasks covering [brief description of what was exported].
```

If export fails, Claude should explain the error and offer to try again or suggest manual export.

## üí° Usage Examples

### Example 1: Project Planning
**User:** "Let's plan out the new website project. I need to research hosting options, create wireframes, set up the development environment, and schedule a client meeting."

**Claude Response:** 
```javascript
fetch('https://todoist.bagofholding.co.uk/quick-export', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: `‚Ä¢ Research hosting options for new website
‚Ä¢ Create wireframes for website layout
‚Ä¢ Set up development environment
‚Ä¢ Schedule client meeting to discuss requirements`,
    mainTaskTitle: "Website Project Planning",
    projectName: "Work"
  })
})
```

**Confirmation:** "‚úÖ I've exported 4 action items to your Todoist Work project. The main task 'Website Project Planning' contains subtasks for researching hosting options, creating wireframes, setting up the development environment, and scheduling a client meeting."

### Example 2: Meeting Follow-up
**User:** "From today's team meeting, export the action items to my Work project in Todoist."

**Claude extracts items from conversation context and exports to Work project**

### Example 3: Personal Planning
**User:** "I have a lot to do this weekend - grocery shopping, cleaning the garage, calling mom, and preparing for Monday's presentation. Can you add these to my tasks?"

**Claude Response:** Creates tasks in Personal project or Inbox with appropriate structure.
